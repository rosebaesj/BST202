# Hi
Hi, I'm Sunjeong Bae, SM1 Epi student for academic year 22-23. 
While we focus mainly on STATA for BST202 during the class, I thought there would be some of us who would want to try them on R.
I'm not an expert on R, but I've been using R in some of my projects. 
So I thought it would be nice to share mine for those of you who want to get started on R.

I'm pretty sure there are some of you who are actually experts in R, 
so please let me know if there's any better way or other ways to approach.
And also any comments on errors, typos etc are welcomed.
Please make an issue or find me.
