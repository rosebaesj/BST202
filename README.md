# Hi
I'm Sunjeong Bae, SM1 Epi student for academic year 22-23. 
While we focus mainly on STATA for BST202 during the class, I'll try them on R.
I'm not an expert on R, but I've been using R in some of my projects. 
Hope this would help who want to get started on R.
\

Fore the experts in R, 
please make comments on "issues" about better/other ways to approach.
Any comments on errors, typos etc are welcomed.
